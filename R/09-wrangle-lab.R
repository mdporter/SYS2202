## A group of students have taken exams in math, science, and English. 
## (a) You want to combine these scores in order to determine a single 
##     performance indicator for each student. 
## (b) Additionally, you want to assign an A to the top 20\% of students, 
##     a B to the next 20\%, and so on. 
## (c) Finally, you want to sort the students alphabetically by last name.
## (d) In addition, you need to create a Cleveland Dot Plot to show the student 
##     name, their score, and their letter grade.
